The purpose of Rytsar is to engage audiences in a collaborative game environment that urges them to get outside their houses and interact with the real world through digital means. In Rytsar, players assume the role of a knight. The player's purpose is to claim territory for their king and earn gold for their land. Doing so brings them honor.
